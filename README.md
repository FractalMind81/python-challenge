# Python Challenge
A repository showcasing my first Python assignment for the UT Data Analytics Boot Camp. The assignment consisted of two challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Python's csv and pandas modules were leveraged throughout. 

### PyBank
Included in the PyBank folder is a main.py file that takes as input budget_data.csv and returns a summary of the financial data included in the csv file. The summary is output to both the terminal and a txt file.  

### PyPoll 
Also included in the PyPoll folder is a main.py file which provides a quick analysis of the polling data found in the election_results.csv file. The analysis is displayed on the terminal and written to a txt file.
